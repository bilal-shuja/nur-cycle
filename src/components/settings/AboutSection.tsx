              <p>
                As a Muslim woman who has struggled for years to understand her own body, I created NurCycle from a place of deep personal need — and deep community love.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this app had existed when I was younger, it would have saved me countless headaches and heartaches. From the confusing hormonal shifts of being a teenager, to the fertility transitions of becoming a wife, to the overwhelming body changes of motherhood — I was constantly left wondering:

              <ul className="space-y-1 text-sm ml-4">
                <li>• Has my period ended or not?</li>
                <li>• Do I wait 40 full days after giving birth or pray once the bleeding stops?</li>
                <li>• Is this spotting istihada or still hayd?</li>
                <li>• Why does every other period app tell me things that don't match my faith?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I was tired of trying to patch together Islamic rulings from blogs, lecture clips, and outdated books — while also scrolling through Western apps that offered sexual advice but no spiritual direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                I looked everywhere for an app made by Muslim women, for Muslim women — and there was nothing.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when I knew: we deserve more. We deserve something that reflects our values. We are no longer minorities — not in number, not in voice, not in brilliance. So why shouldn't we have our own tools, our own spaces, our own systems?
              </p>
              <p>
                NurCycle is that space. It is for you. It is for us.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am endlessly grateful to Allah for giving me the opportunity to give back to my sisters — to the ummah I love so dearly.
